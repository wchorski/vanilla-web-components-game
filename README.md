## What Is This Project For?

This project serves as a learning process for beginner developers or someone who needs a break from all the _frameworks_ and _package dependancies_.

- Fundimental web standards.
- No build tools or external packages
- source code that runs in the browser
- Development template base for simple webdev projects
- Uses jsDoc for type safety
- Pure CSS animations

## TODO

-
- [ ] save playfield item data type and location (fruits, weeds, toys) and repopulate on initGame
- [ ] use routine function with probability `chance` weights
- [ ] have a pet limit of ~6?
- [x] if hunger is below `0.2` trigger cry instead of sleep
- [x] touch / mobile input!!!!!!!! with `touch` instead of `drag` w/e
- [x] figure local storage or sqlite to save ring count
- [x] custom cursor w glove
- [ ] make weeds apear randomly
- [ ] able to pluck weeds
- [ ] health meters
  - [ ] sleep (sleep raises energy and sleep)
  - [ ] hunger (food lowers hunger and boosts energy)
  - [ ] energy (too much energy is bad)
    - uses energy passively or if given toys
  - [ ] cant style `<meter>` so moving to `<progress>` tag instead
  - [ ] Sleep
    - engergy is below half
    - hunger is above full
    - sleep meter doesn't fill as fast when hungerPoints are high
    - sleep (naptime) happens at regular intervals and duration is usually the same (slight variable?)
- [x] drag and drop fruit to feed (and other items)
- [ ] look into [JsDocs](https://depth-first.com/articles/2021/10/20/types-without-typescript/)
